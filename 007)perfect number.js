//Write a JavaScript function which says whether a number is perfect.
//What is that anyways? 
//In number theory, a perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum 
// of its proper positive divisors, that is, the sum of its positive divisors
//  excluding the number itself (also known as its aliquot sum). Equivalently, 
//  a perfect number is a number that is half the sum of all of its positive 
//  divisors (including itself).
//Example: 6 --> 1 + 2 + 3 = 6 --> its perfectly divisible
        // 28 = 1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14 
function is_perfect(number){
  //code 
} 
is_perfect(28);  //It is a perfect number.
